							<h2>Horse Leasing</h2>
						</header>
<p>
Our horses are suited for trail rides, back country and pleasure riding. We use these horses with all aspects of our own
outfitting business. Having sold some of our outfitting areas but still wanting to work with the horse side we started leasing
horses in 2010. They have been in kids camps in Idaho, with several different outfitters in both Montana and Idaho and with
do-it-yourself clients. We match the horses for the type riding you will be doing and the experience level of the riders.

							<h2>Cabin Rental</h2>
						</header>
<p>
We have two cabins right alongside the Clark Fork river.  These cabins were built in 2005 and are near our Horse Motel. 
The cabins can be combined with other activities for a package deal.
<br/><br/>
We have now added (for the more traditional adventurous) a TeePee. This is an 18' TeePee which lets you experience the
old way without being too far from modern facilities. Great view of the Clark Fork River.
