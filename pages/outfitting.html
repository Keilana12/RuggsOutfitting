							<h2><a href="/outfitting">Big Game Hunting</a></h2>
						</header>
<p>
Montana's big game hunting is second to none.  We offer highly personable and quality hunts with a maximum of four
hunters on guided hunts and six on drop camps, restricting it to one camp per area at a time.  For the guided bow hunts
and mountain lion hunts, we hold to a maximum of two hunters at a time to ensure quality.  The pack-in hunts require
strenuous physical exertion while the ranch hunts require much less effort and are more accessible.
<br/><br/>
Our big game hunts include Elk, Mule Deer, White-tailed Deer, Bear, Moose, Mountain Lion, Sheep, and Wolf.

							<h2>Float Trips / Fishing</h2>
						</header>
<p>
Our float trips are based out of our ranch in Superior, Montana.  Multi-day trips spend each night there in a modern house
with home-cooked meals.  We float the Clark Fork River with over 70 miles of scenic beauty and adventure.
<br/><br/>
<b>Whitewater:</b> Our whitewater trips run the famed Alberton Gorge, which boasts over 20 rapids and offers a new adventure each trip.
<br/>
<b>Leisure Floats:</b> Relax and enjoy the river, swim, view the scenary and wildlife. We are licensed for the Clark Fork,
Bitterroot, and Blackfoot Rivers, as well as most of the other rivers in Western Montana.
<br/>
<b>Float Fishing:</b> The Rainbow, Cutthroat, and Brown Trout fight to get on your hook on this stretch of the river.  We are
licensed for the Clark Fork, Bitteroot, and Blackfoot Rivers.

							<h2>Summer Pack Trips</h2>
						</header>
<p>
During the summer months, we offer wilderness excursions designed entirely around your preferences. Some of the options that
you might wish to integrate into your family vacation include scenic and wildlife photography, lake and stream fishing, hiking,
trail riding, and camping, among others. These excursions are appropriate for families, couples, or groups.
<br/><br/>
We arrange these entirely from your plans and desires when you tell us what you would like from your wilderness excursion.  Our
most popular trip over the last couple of years has been:
<ul>
  <li><b>3 days/2 nights</b> in the mountains (horseback riding, camping, mountain lake fishing)</li>
  <li><b>1 day</b> white water float through the famed Alberton Gorge</li>
  <li><b>1 day</b> leisure or fishing float on the Clark Fork River</li>
</ul>
The main emphasis on all of our trips is sharing in our joy of providing a true western experience.
