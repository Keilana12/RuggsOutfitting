							<h2>Elk</h2>

<p>
We do both Bow & Rifle hunts from our remote pack-in-camps along the Montana-Idaho state line.  We hunt during the
rut and in an area that seldom sees other hunters. Because of the terrain and the difficulty getting into the area
you have the place all to yourself. This is also true with our rifle hunts from the pack-in camps.
<br/><br/>
For the hunter that wants a little comfort, we do late season hunts from our modern cabins. With these hunts you and
the guide are usually dropped off from vehicles in the morning and then are hunting on foot back to a pick-up point.
<br/><br/>
We offer both guided (including guide, cook, food, camp gear, and transportation to/from camp), and drop camps (including
camp gear and transportation to/from camp). You are responsible for: License, Taxidermy, Meat Processing, and Transportation
to/from the Lodge.

							<h2>Deer</h2>
						</header>
<p>
We have both White-tailed and Mule Deer in our area. Hunts can either be from the pack-in camps or ranch hunts.
For the Mule Deer, our area is classified as a trophy area so tags are on a draw and must be applied for by March 15th.
<br/><br/>
For the pack-in camps, we offer a combo hunt and advise the hunter to get the combo license which includes Elk.
With the pack-in camps we offer both guided & drop camps.
<br/><br/>
The ranch hunts for Deer have you staying in modern cabins and hunting from blinds.

							<h2>Bear</h2>
						</header>
<p>
We offer both spring and fall Bear hunts. In Montana you can not bait or use dogs for Bear hunting. Our hunts consist of spot and stalk.
The spring hunts are day trips out of our lodge. Usually riding out on horseback and then scoping open hillsides. The fall hunts can be
from the lodge or pack into tent camps and hunting from there.
<br/><br/>
We do have Black, Brown, Blond & Cinnamon color Bears but mostly Black or Brown.
<br/><br/>
The Bear hunts are 5 days of actual hunting

							<h2>Mountain Lion</h2>
						</header>
<p>
Our Mountain Lion Hunts are phenomenal. With 20 years of hunting the big cats, we have only had 2 hunters go home without a cat.
The first time was our very first cat hunter and we booked the hunt for specific days (live and learn) instead of adjusting to account
for weather conditions. The second was a return hunter who wanted a bigger cat than he took on his first hunt. While we found cats, we
did not find a bigger one. That hunter is booked again this year. We have had hunters come on multiple years and go home with a cat each year.
<br/><br/>
For many years we took at least 2 of the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place awards for Montana. When our houndsman moved away, we contacted the other top
houndsman that we had been competing with for those awards and now we work together. A win-win deal.
<br/><br/>
Ours is a draw area but if you do not get drawn we have a late season starting February 1st with over the counter tags which is just as good.
Our full season runs from 1 December - 14 April.  Terrain can be steep but we have also taken cats within 50 yards of the pick-up you are riding in.

							<h2>Moose</h2>
						</header>
<p>
Moose hunts in our area are all by draw and there are not many tags. Because of this we do not take many Moose hunters, but it also means that
if you are lucky enough to get a tag, the odds of getting a Moose is very high.  We are 100% on our Moose hunts. The Moose in our area are the
Shiras Moose and do not get the big antlers like they have in Alaska, but are they ever good eating.
<br/><br/>
We do these hunts as day hunts either out of our modern cabins or our lodge, depending on which area that you draw a tag. You will be going out
each day either on horseback or with vehicles and hunting spot and stalk. Our prime time is the beginning of October. That is when Moose are
in the rut and you can do some calling.

							<h2>Sheep</h2>
						</header>
<p>
We are in a limited draw area for Sheep but have some very nice Rams. With these hunts we are 100% successful.
<br/><br/>
The terrain can be very steep and require a lot of climbing but we have had Sheep roll right down to the road.
Part of the excitement of the hunt is watching rams square off and hit each other.
<br/><br/>
In most areas, the prime rut is the second week of November but we have found that in our area the best time is
actually the first week of November.

							<h2>Wolf</h2>
						</header>
<p>
Come and help our wildlife.  We are doing our Wolf hunts in December, January & February.
<br/><br/>
Montana has gotten proactive on Wolf hunting and now allows up to 5 tags per hunter. They have also dropped their
non-resident tag fee to $50.00 per tag.
<br/><br/>
We are hunting these mainly by driving back roads while looking for fresh tracks. Then setting up with calls to bring them to us.
Our permitted area covers about 2,000 square miles. Lodging is in modern cabins right on the Clark Fork River.
